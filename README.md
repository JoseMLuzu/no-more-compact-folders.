# No More Compact Folders

**No More Compact Folders** is a Visual Studio Code extension that automatically disables the annoying 'Compact Folders' setting. This ensures that nested folders in the Explorer are always fully expanded, giving you a better overview of your project structure. No more collapsing single-subfolder chains into a single line!

## Features

- Automatically disables the **Compact Folders** setting upon installation.
- Provides a smoother and more intuitive folder navigation experience.
- Improves folder visibility by eliminating the need to constantly expand folders manually.

Hereâ€™s what it looks like in action:
